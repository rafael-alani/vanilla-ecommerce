# vanilla-ecommerce
An ecommerce website created only using vanilla Javascript CSS and HTML.

This is going to be the first website I build after a month in which I mostly learned theory. Which is probably an very inefective method of learning to code. :)

The website is going to be built with the help of [a great youtube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8YuWEkTeuE)
